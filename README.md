# MountainQuest-PL
Little book containing mountain shelters in Poland. Each page contains data, picture, map, description and place for stamp. Put it in your pocket, hit the road and collect all stamps! :-)

Repository contains both srouce code (Java) which was used to generate PDF and PDF itself.
Shalters' data was taken for muliple pages but the majority of it from http://www.gdzie-wyjechac.pl/pl/pasma-gorskie/.

Java code was writen do to it's work and is not DRY, SOLID, KISS etc... so don't expect tests ;-).
PDF is generated using itext library.

I've done it purly for me, my family and my friends but if you find it usefull then help yourself. 

Ow, almost forget... generated PDF is in polish.
